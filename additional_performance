Client side asynchronous mode is another method, that can be used to improve
the performance of Network File System. Client side asynchronous mode uses
the client's RAM as a giant cache. Once enabled, writes to the NFS server
are instead written to the client's RAM. The file gets written to server 
only if one of the following conditions are met:
    * Memory fills up
    * An application flushes cache using sync, fsync or msync
    * A file is closed with close()
    * A file is locked/unlocked using fcntl

That is, when using client side asynchronous mode, writes to the server are
drastically reduced. This benefits both the client doing the write and the
environment as a whole. For the client, it reduces the number of instances
it has to transfer data to the server. For the server, it reduces the
number of writes it has to deal with in unit time. This also means that the
rest of the clients have to wait less to read/write to the server.

An NFS system with server side and client side asynchronous mode was
benchmarked with client side options in /etc/fstab set as
[rw, async, hard, intr, 0 0] and server side options in /etc/exports set as
[rw, no_root_squash, no_subtree_check, async]
