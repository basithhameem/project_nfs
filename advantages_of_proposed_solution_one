The proposed solution has a number of advantages, the most important one
being higher security against data corruption and loss. With the current 
system, server side asynchronous mode is turned off by default, due to 
concerns about data loss. The proposed solution once implemented, virtually
eliminates the chance of data loss and makes it safe to leave the server
side asynchronous mode turned on.

The solution allows the NFS environment to maintain high speeds while
keeping chances of data loss negligibly low. The solution is also easy to
implement as it requires changes to only the NFS protocol and leaves the
Operating System untouched.
