The proposed solution has several advantages, the most important one
being higher security against data corruption and loss. With the current 
system, due to concerns pertaining to data loss, the server side
asynchronous mode is turned off by default. The proposed solution once
implemented, virtually eliminates the chance of data loss and makes it safe
to leave the server side asynchronous mode turned on.

The solution allows the NFS environment to maintain high speeds while
keeping chances of data loss negligibly low. The solution is also easy to
implement as it requires changes to the NFS protocol alone, leaving the
Operating System untouched.
