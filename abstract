Network File System is a commonly used distributed file system, allowing the
user to access and manipulate storage on remote computers as if they were
part of the local machine. Network File System is notoriously slow in its 
default configuration. This is accentuated if the NFS environment has more 
than a dozen clients. When configured to deliver faster speeds by turning on
asynchronous mode, the system suffers from higher risk of data corruption 
and loss.

This paper proposes a number of modifications to the Network File System
allowing the file system to provide very high performance, while minimizing
the risk of data loss and corruption. Further, the proposed system behaves
better in congested networks by consuming less bandwidth ensuring decent
speeds even during periods of heavy network traffic.
