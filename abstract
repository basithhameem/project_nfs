Network File System is a widely used distributed file system that allows the
user to access and manipulate storage on remote computers, as if they were a
part of the local machine. Network File System is notoriously slow in its 
default configuration and the incorporation of more than a dozen clients in the 
NFS environment merely accentuates the delay. When configured to deliver faster
speeds by turning on asynchronous mode, the system suffers from higher risk of 
data corruption and loss.

This study proposes variegated modifications to the Network File System,
enabling it to provide elevated system performance, while containing
the risk of data loss and corruption. Further, the proposed system behaves
better in congested networks by consuming less bandwidth, ensuring decent
speeds, even during periods of heavy network traffic.
