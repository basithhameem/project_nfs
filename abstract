Network File System is a widely used distributed file system that allows the
user to access and manipulate storage on remote computers, as if they were a
part of the local machine. Network File System is notoriously slow in its 
default configuration and if more clients connects to the NFS environment,
it merely accentuates the delay. When configured to deliver faster speeds,
the system suffers from higher risk of data corruption and loss.

This study proposes a number of modifications to the Network File System,
enabling it to provide elevated system performance, while containing
the risk of data loss and corruption. Further, the proposed system behaves
better in congested networks by consuming less bandwidth, ensuring decent
speeds, even during periods of heavy network traffic.
