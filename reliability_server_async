An advantage of enabling server side asynchronous mode is that, more
clients can access the server in unit time. A side effect is that it can
cause a write queue to form on the client side. A file write can get delayed
and writing a file to the server gives no guarantee that it has been written
to permanent storage. In the event of a server crash, the data written
immediatly before can be lost. Worryingly, the data can be lost from more
than one computer connected to the NFS server.

A client has no means of protecting itself from a server crash. A client has
no NFS cache that is permanent in nature. Even if the client has the lost
file in its primary memory, there is a high chance of loosing it. This is
because, if prior to crash the server was serving a critical file, the
application dependant on the file can crash as well. If the application is
part of the Operating System, it can bring down the whole computer. The
latter is often the case with environments where home directory is served by
an NFS share. Thus, with the current system, server side asynchronous mode
is rather a risky option to leave turned on.
