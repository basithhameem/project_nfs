An advantage of enabling server side asynchronous mode is that, more
clients can access the server in unit time. A side effect is that it can
cause a write queue to form on the client side. That is, writing a file to
the server gives no guarantee that it has been written to permanent storage.
In the event of a server crash, the data written immediatly before can be
lost. frustrating part is when the data loss affects most of the clients which 
has written to the server shortly before the crash, and not just a single 
computer.

If a server crash occurs, a client has no means of protecting itself from
the data loss. A client has no NFS cache that is permanent in nature. Even
if the client has the lost file in its primary memory, there is a high
chance of loosing it. This is because, if prior to crash the server was
serving a critical configuration file, the application dependant on the file
can crash as well. If the application is part of the Operating System, it can bring
down the whole system. The latter is often the case with environments where
home directory is served by an NFS share. Thus, with the current system,
server side asynchronous mode is rather a risky option to leave turned on.
