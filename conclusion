Network File System, though introduced in 1984, is still a widely deployed
distributed file system. The paper introduces a couple of methods which can
enhance the reliability and performance of the Network File System.

The paper proposes a pseudo ring buffer on the client's secondary storage
and proposes changes to the behaviour of NFS client and server to 
drastically reduce the rate of data corruption and loss when using server
side asynchronous mode. The paper also proposes changes in behaviour of the
NFS client and server when using client side asynchronous mode with an aim 
to reduce data loss and improve overall performance of the system.

Once implemented, the changes suggested in this paper can enhance the
performance of the NFS protocol while bringing down risk of data corruption
and loss.
