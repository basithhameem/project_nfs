good afternoon friends

I am going to present my paper titled "Enhancing the Performance and Reliability
of Network File System".

With this paper, we are trying to introduce a number of methods for increasing
the general performance and reducing chances of data correction with the Network
File System.

NFS is a generic term, it can refer to any network protocol which allows
accessing files on a remote disk. But today, we are talking about SUN's NFS,
which was first introduced way back in 1985.

It is still being actively developed, and is widely deployed across 
organizations, often with a directory access protocol such as LDAP.

This allows people to log into their user accounts and access their files from
any machine on the network.
