Once VFS handovers the write request to NFS client, it transfers the 
received data to the server rather than writing it to the local storage. In
case of data loss, the file cannot be recovered, as the only copy of the
file was in server's memory. The solution is to create a buffer in the 
client's local storage such that, a copy of all the data written to server 
will be kept with the client.

The buffer is a predefined storage area in the client's secondary memory.
It acts like a ring buffer with a fixed memory size. The oldest files are
deleted once the buffer reaches its capacity. NFS client will maintain a 
plaintext file in the buffer containing names of each file in the buffer,
its path and hash generated from each file. During an NFS write operation,
the client stores a copy of the file in the buffer area and updates the 
metadata file with the information regarding the  new file. Figure shows the 
working and structure of the buffer.
