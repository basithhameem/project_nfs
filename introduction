Network File System is a distributed File System protocol primarily used by
UNIX family of Operating Systems. It allows a user to mount, access and
manipulate a disk partition or directory on a remote computer as if the
said partition or directory was a part of the local machine. Network File
System was developed as an open standard by SUN Microsystems in 1984.

NFS is widely used in Local Area Networks to conviniently share data and
provide users the ability to access their files across the network.
Sometimes, a directory access protocol such as LDAP is combined with NFS to
allow users to login to their user account from any computer on the network.

The main drawback of NFS is the slow read and write speeds it offers with
the default setup. Though NFS offers a number of parameters in its
configuration files to increase the performance, these either do not
affect the performance much or increases the chance of data corruption and
loss. Thus the users are forced to run the system with the default, slow
configuration.

In many environments, this leads to lost human productivity as the computers
