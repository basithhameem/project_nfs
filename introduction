Network File System is a distributed File System protocol primarily used by the  
UNIX family of Operating Systems. It allows users to mount, access and
manipulate disk partitions or directories on a remote computer, as if the
said partition or directory was a part of the local machine. Network File
System was developed as an open standard by SUN Microsystems in 1984.

NFS is widely used in Local Area Networks to conveniently share data, and
provides users the ability to access their files across the network.
Occasionally, a directory access protocol such as LDAP is combined with NFS,
allowing the users to login to their user accounts from any computer on the 
network.

The crucial setback NFS depicts is the slow read and write speeds it offers
with the default setup.The existent performance enhancing parameters in its 
default setup configuration files, either leave the performance rates unaffected
or increases the probability of data corruption and loss. Thus the users are 
forced to run the system with the default, slow configuration.

The aforestated strategy diminishes the possibilities of interactive computing, 
and an Operating System requiring access to data on NFS share, often ends up 
freezing the computer in it's entirety, resulting environments with lost human 
productivity. Moreover, this bottlenecks the computer CPU, thereby exhausting
valuable computing resources. 

This paper proposes a number of changes to the Network File System protocol
which increases the performance of Network File System while reducing
the risk of data corruption and loss. The proposed system also ensures
decent speeds in congested network as it consumes less bandwidth than the 
original NFS implementation and protects the ability of the NFS server to
provide access to files during period of peak network activity.
