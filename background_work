Past projects have proposed new Network File System protocols for
transmitting data over Wide Area Networks. Some other papers have dealt with
improving the performance of NFS over wireless links.

A.Muthitacharoen, B.Chen and D.Mazieres has proposed a Low Bandwidth Network
File System, which can be used over Wide Area Networks such as the Internet.
Though it minimizes the bandwidth usage of the protocol, it is meant for 90s
era internet. To use it in current scenario would require extensive 
modification to the protocol and it is not compatible with SUN's NFS.

R.Dube, C.D Rais and S.K Tripathi has proposed a number of changes to the
network stack to increase the performance of NFS over wireless links. The
paper does not suggest changes to the NFS protocol, instead it tries to
optimize the wireless network stack.

In our literature review, we are yet to come across a paper, which directly
deals with enhancing the performance and reducing data corruption rates of 
the widely adopted Network File System originally implemented by SUN 
Microsystems.
