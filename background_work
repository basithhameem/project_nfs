Past studies have proposed new Network File System protocols for
transmitting data over Wide Area Networks. Some other research have dealt
with improving the performance of NFS over wireless links.

A.Muthitacharoen Et al. has proposed a Low Bandwidth Network File System,
which can be used over Wide Area Networks such as the Internet. Though it
minimizes the bandwidth usage of the protocol, it is meant for '90s
era internet. To use it in current scenario would require extensive 
modification to the protocol and it is not compatible with SUN's NFS.

R.Dube Et al. has proposed several changes to the network stack to increase
the performance of NFS over wireless links. The paper does not suggest
changes to the NFS protocol, instead it tries to optimize the wireless
network stack.

In our literature review, we are yet to come across a research, which
squarely deals with enhancing the performance and reducing data corruption
rates of the widely adopted Network File System protocol, originally
implemented by SUN Microsystems.
