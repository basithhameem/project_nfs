In server side synchronous mode, the server waits till the data has been 
written to its disk before returning the acknowledgment message to the 
client. Server side asynchronous mode changes the behaviour of NFS server 
such that it returns the acknowledgment message as soon as the client 
completes the transfer of data. This has tremendous impact on the
performance of the system.

An NFS system with server side asynchronous mode was benchmarked with the
client side options in /etc/fstab set as [rw, sync, hard, intr 0 0] and
server side options in /etc/exports set as 
[rw, no_root_squash, no_subtree_check, async]. The test was conducted using
dbench tool - part of phoronix test suite, and resulted in 28.72 MB/s, a
huge increase in performance boost, compared with the earlier server side
synchronous mode, which returned 0.94 MB/s. The performance graph obtained
has been shown in figure.

Further benchmarks were also conducted with dd utility, with a block size
of 1KB, file size of 2GB and fdatasync option turned on. The block size of
1K ensures the computer writes only 1KB of data at a time and the fdatasync
option flushes the cache after each block is written. The aim was to
understand the performance of the system without the contribution of client
side caches. The benchmark resulted in 7.1 MB/s which was stil significantly
higher than results recorded with server side asynchronous mode.
