The whole NFS system is tried to benchmark using virtual machine and nfs version 4.2 is used for simulation. 
One of the main reason to use virtual machine is that, they provide a number of networking hardware specifications 
which allow us to simulate target machine network hardware properties. Virtual machine is free to use, fast and easy 
to implement. A 100 Mbps bridged adapter is setup in the virtual machine to directly to outside network. In other 
words NAT (Network Address Translation) is not used because in NAT the translation is done by the CPU. This 
make sure that CPU will not bottleneck the system simulation. Benchmarking the system was a tedious process 
because of the absence of proper benchmarking tool. The benchmarking was properly completed by combing some 
of the available tools. Bonnie ++, Phoronix, Dbench and dd-the command line utility was used. The main 
disadvantages of first three test suits was caching effect. This was effectively avoided by using the command line 
utility "dd". Dbench is a powerful benchmarking tool which itself can simulate upto 512 clients by its own.
Benchmarking was done through proper combination of all these tools.

dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/user_1/tmp_file bsize=1K count=2048000 conv=fdatasync
 
 The "conv=fdatasync" option flushes each 1 KB of data from cache and this ensures that caching effect on virtual 
 machine and nfs performance is zero.
