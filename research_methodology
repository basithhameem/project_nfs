All the benchmarks for this research paper has been done using NFS v4.2.
The NFS environment comprising of client and server were emulated using
virtual machines, with the Oracle VirtualBox hypervisor. Virtual Machines 
(VMs) provide a convinient method of simulating target hardware and 
networking infrastructure. The VirtualBox hypervisor was run on RedHat 
Enterprise Linux 7.2 with the hardware being an HP-Z640 workstation to 
ensure the VMs were not bottlenecked during benchmarks.

The VMs were equipped with AMD PCnet-FAST III 100 Mbps network adapter,
which was bridged to the network so that each VM was represented as a real
machine on the network. Network Address Translation (NAT) was not used as
NAT consumes CPU resources, which could in turn affect benchmarks. The
benchmarking tools used include Bonnie ++, Phoronix Test Suite/iozone,
Phoronix Test Suite/dbench, Stand-alone Dbench and the "dd" utility. dd was
used to perform benchmarks were client side cache effects needed to be
avoided. Dbench is a powerful benchmarking tool which is capable of 
emulating upto 512 clients.
Benchmarking was done through proper combination of all these tools.

dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/user_1/tmp_file bsize=1K count=2048000 conv=fdatasync
 
 The "conv=fdatasync" option flushes each 1 KB of data from cache and this ensures that caching effect on virtual 
 machine and nfs performance is zero.
