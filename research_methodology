All the benchmarks for this research paper has been done using NFS v4.2.
The NFS environment comprising of client and server were emulated using
virtual machines, with the Oracle VirtualBox hypervisor. Virtual Machines 
(VMs) provide a convinient method of simulating target hardware and 
networking infrastructure. The VirtualBox hypervisor was run on RedHat 
Enterprise Linux 7.2 with the hardware being an HP-Z640 workstation to 
ensure the VMs were not bottlenecked during benchmarks. The VMs were 
equipped with AMD PCnet-FAST III 100 Mbps network adapter, which was bridged
to the network so that each VM was represented as a real machine on the 
network. Network Address Translation (NAT) was not used as NAT consumes CPU
resources, which could in turn affect benchmarks. 

The benchmarking tools used include Bonnie ++, Phoronix Test Suite/iozone,
Phoronix Test Suite/dbench, Stand-alone Dbench and the "dd" utility. dd was
used to perform benchmarks were client side cache effects needed to be
avoided. Dbench is a powerful benchmarking tool designed to test the
performance of NFS and SMB systems. It is capable of emulating upto 512 
clients. All the benchmarks where done with Dbench emulating 6 clients.
Benchmarking was often done through proper combination of all these tools.
When eliminating client side cache effect was required, dd was run with 
"conv=fdatasync bs=1K" options to flush data from cache after write of each
KB.
