All the benchmarks for this research study has been done using NFS v4.2.
The NFS environment encompassing the client and server, was emulated using
virtual machines, with the Oracle VirtualBox hypervisor. Virtual Machines 
(VMs) provide a convenient method of simulating target hardware and 
networking infrastructure. The VirtualBox hypervisor was run on RedHat 
Enterprise Linux 7.2, with the hardware being an HP-Z640 workstation to 
ensure the VMs were not bottlenecked during benchmarks. The VMs were 
equipped with an AMD PCnet-FAST III 100 Mbps network adapter which was bridged
to the network, so that each VM represented a real machine on the 
network. Network Address Translation (NAT) was not used as it consumes CPU
resources, which could in turn affect benchmarks. The NFS server and client
VMs were set up to run Debian 9.3 (Stable) as their OS. Debian is a heavily
tested distribution that ships with highly stable packages. Debian was chosen
so as to minimize the chance of bugs affecting the benchmarks.

The benchmarking tools used include Bonnie ++, Phoronix Test Suite/iozone,
Phoronix Test Suite/dbench, Stand-alone Dbench and the "dd" utility. dd was
used to perform benchmarks where client side cache effects needed to be
avoided. Dbench is a powerful benchmarking tool designed to test the
performance of NFS and SMB systems. It is capable of emulating upto 512 
clients. All the benchmarks were done with Dbench emulating 6 clients.
Benchmarking was often done through proper combination of all these tools.
When eliminating client side cache effect was required, dd was run with 
"conv=fdatasync bs=1K" options to flush data from cache after write of each
KB.
