NFS operates on the client-server architecture. There are tweaks that can
be applied to NFS both at the client and server end. At the client end, the
tweaks are made to /etc/fstab file, while at the server end, the configuration
is done to the /etc/exports file. Some of the commonly used options are
listed below.

NFS Client side options

Slno    Option              Description
1       rw                  Enable Read/Write
2       sync	            Client side synchronous mode
3       hard	            If write fails, infinite retries
4       intr	            Deprecated option. Ignored after kernel 2.6.25
5       nfsvers	            Specify the NFS version
6       rsize	            Set read cache size
7       wsize	            Set write cache size.
8       udp		            Use UDP instead of TCP
9       async	            Client side asynchronous write 

NFS Server side options

Slno    Option              Description
1	    rw                  Read/Write
2	    no_root_squash      Turn of root squashing
3	    subtree_check       Verify accessed path is part of NFS share
4	    async               Server side asynchronous mode
5	    sync                Server side synchronous mode

Various combinations of these options were benchmarked. It was observed that
most of the options showed no augmented performance in the NFS environment with 
the ball park performance estimate of 0.94 MB/s.

Figure 0.77 MB/s

One significant characteristic observed was that the client side UDP option 
reduced the speeds to 0.77 MB/s. The end of experiments resulted in the 
observation that, only the client and server side provided a considerable 
elevated performance.
