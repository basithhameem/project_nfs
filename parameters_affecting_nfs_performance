Testing environment
Testing environment is set up in a HP-Z640 Desktop Workstation running RHEL 
(RedHat Enterprise Linux). A NFS server and six clients were setup on a virtual machine.
Dbench is specifically meant for SMB/NFS benchmarking.
Using the above tools for benchmarking, various tests were run on the previously setup environment.
There are various factors that can be manipulated in the configuration of NFS server side and client side.
NFS client side configuration is done in "/etc/fstab" whereas NFS server side configuration is done in "/etc/exports".
Client side options were
[Tabular Description of NFS client side options]
Slno  Option      Description
1           rw              Read/Write
2           syn			    Sync file system with the server
3           hard			    NFS requests are retried indefinitely
4           intr			    Provided for backward compatibility. Ignored after kernel 2.6.25
5           nfsvers		    Specifies the nfs versions
6           rsize			    The maximum number of bytes when reading data
7           wsize		    The maximum number of bytes when writing data to a file.
8           udp			    Specifies the connection to UDP
9           async	        Asynchronous write.

Slno	    Option                         Description
1		    rw                                Read/Write
2		    no_root_squash           Turn off root squashing
3		    subtree_check              Verifies the specified directory/its subrectory for access
4		    async                           Synchronous write
5		    sync                            Asynchronous write

Various combinations of these options were experimentally simulated in the above mentioned environment. 
Test span was  from 40 minutes to 12 hours. Test span depends upon the combination of tools we use and 
the options we enforce in "/etc/fstab" and "/etc/exports". It is found that there is considerable decrese in performance 
when UDP used in client side. Write speed decrement 0.94 MB/s to 0.77 MB/s . More importantly there is 
sharp increase in the performance by turning on "async" mode on both server side and client side.
