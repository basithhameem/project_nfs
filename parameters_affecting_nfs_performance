NFS configuration at the client end are in /etc/fstab file, while at the
server end, the configuration are in /etc/exports file. The commonly used
options are listed in TABLE I and TABLE II

NFS Client side options 
[Tabular Description of NFS client side options]
Slno    Option              Description
1       rw                  Enable Read/Write
2       sync	            Client side synchronous mode
3       hard	            If write fails, infinite retries
4       intr	            Deprecated option. Ignored after kernel 2.6.25
5       nfsvers	            Specify the NFS version
6       rsize	            Set read cache size
7       wsize	            Set write cache size.
8       udp		            Use UDP instead of TCP
9       async	            Client side asynchronous write 

NFS Server side options
[Tabular Description of NFS server side options]
Slno    Option              Description
1	    rw                  Read/Write
2	    no_root_squash      Turn of root squashing
3	    subtree_check       Verify accessed path is part of NFS share
4	    async               Server side asynchronous mode
5	    sync                Server side synchronous mode

Various combinations of these options were benchmarked. It was observed 
that most of the options did not improve the performance of the NFS
environment. Server performance remained at 0.94 MB/s.

One significant characteristic observed was that the client side UDP option 
reduced the speeds to 0.77 MB/s. The end of experiments resulted in the 
observation that, only the client and server side asynchronous mode provided
a considerable elevation in performance.
